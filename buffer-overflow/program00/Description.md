## Lesson 00: Controling the behavior of the program
The lesson is to learn how to control the behavior of the program through the eip(register), which basically points to a return address.

So if we can control the return address, we can control the program and direct it to
execute our malicious code.

### Key Terms:
- `eip`: This is the most important register(a small, high-speed storage location within the CPU that holds data or instructions for immediate use by the processor), which stores the address of the next instruction.
- `return address`: Occurs in the stack frame of a function, which holds the address that tells the program when to go after execution.
